        <h1>Introduction</h1>

        <p>After finishing a 3 year course in Management and Programming of Computer Systems I am now studying mobile development and looking to invest in gaming in my developer career.</p>
        <p>My experience in the area is a 5 month Internship at Reditus SA in web development where I got to work with new tools such as Angular.</p>
        <p>My most valuable skills would be C# development and Image and UI editing through tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.</p>
        <p>I was also able to greatly improve my communication skills in a 3 month part-time job at a retail store where I worked closely with clients and gave them advice on computer software and hardware purchases.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I was born on February 7th 1996 in Angola and around when I turned 4 I moved with my family to Portugal where I grew up and am still living.</p>
        <p>When I was little I really liked playing with legos and wanted to study architecture or civil engineering like my uncle but that changed as soon as I met a computer for the first time. I was amazed at all the possibilities it brought with it and soon changed what I aspired to do in the future.</p>
        <p>I am mostly a very calm and passive individual but can get out of my shell if I am excited about something or when discussing something of my interest.</p>

        <h2>Languages</h2>

        <p>- Portuguese (Mother Tongue)</p>
        <p>- English</p>

        <h2>Strenghts</h2>

        <p>I am very passionate about what I really like and having 2 younger brothers made me a more responsible person since I had to look out for them.</p>

        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>

        <p>Like most human beings I have a lot of flaws and I have been able to improve in some areas but the one that I am the least proud of would be that I am a really slow starter.</p>
